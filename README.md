# üìä FreeCodeCamp - Data Analysis with Python Certification Projects

Welcome! This repository contains all five required projects for the [freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/). Each project is organized for submission and for ease of reference, with well-documented Jupyter Notebooks provided outside their respective folders.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **Submission folders** contain `.py` files formatted specifically for freeCodeCamp‚Äôs submission requirements.
- **Notebook files** (`.ipynb`) are added in the main folder to provide readable and interactive versions of each project, ideal for learning, reviewing, and sharing.

## üß† Projects Overview

1. **Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator**
   - Uses Numpy to calculate statistical metrics from a 3x3 matrix.

2. **Demographic Data Analyzer**
   - Analyzes demographic data from a census dataset using Pandas.

3. **Medical Data Visualizer**
   - Visualizes medical examination data through bar plots, heatmaps, and categorical plots.

4. **Page View Time Series Visualizer**
   - Creates visualizations (line, bar, box plots) for page views data.

5. **Sea Level Predictor**
   - Uses linear regression to predict future sea levels based on historical data.
